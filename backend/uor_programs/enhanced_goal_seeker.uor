# Enhanced UOR Goal-Seeker Pseudocode
# Addresses 200-299 used for circular buffer of previous failed attempts
# Algorithms implemented in this design:
#   STORE_FAILURE      - save a failed guess at current buffer pointer
#   CHECK_HISTORY      - check buffer to prevent repeat guesses
#   CALC_ERROR         - |target - attempt| -> categorize (small, medium, large)
#   ADAPTIVE_STEP      - determine step size based on error magnitude
#   UPDATE_BOUNDS      - maintain min/max bounds for binary search
#   ANALYZE_HISTORY    - detect arithmetic/geometric sequence from successes
#
# The program cycles through three search strategies and switches after
# 10 consecutive failures:
#   1. Random search with step size from ADAPTIVE_STEP
#   2. Binary search using UPDATE_BOUNDS
#   3. Pattern recognition search using ANALYZE_HISTORY
#
# Memory layout notes:
#   100-109 : control counters and state (strategy id, failure count, etc.)
#   110-119 : last known bounds for binary search
#   120-129 : pattern recognition workspace
#   200-299 : circular buffer storing last 100 failed attempts
#
# Main loop outline:
#   0:  LOAD current attempt value
#   1:  EXECUTE selected modification slot
#   2:  PRINT attempt and request feedback
#   3:  If success:
#         - RESET failure count
#         - STORE successful value for pattern analysis
#         - UPDATE_BOUNDS with success
#         - Jump back to start with next target
#   4:  If failure:
#         - STORE_FAILURE at buffer pointer
#         - INCREMENT failure counter
#         - CALC_ERROR of attempt
#         - ADAPTIVE_STEP to choose next delta
#         - CHECK_HISTORY to avoid repeats
#         - Depending on current strategy, compute next attempt:
#             a) Random search: random +/- step
#             b) Binary search: midpoint between bounds
#             c) Pattern recognition: extrapolate from ANALYZE_HISTORY
#         - UPDATE_BOUNDS with failed value when needed
#         - Switch strategy if 10 failures reached
#         - LOOP
#
# The actual numeric UOR chunks are not provided here. This file serves as
# a high-level reference for implementing the enhanced program in future
# versions.
