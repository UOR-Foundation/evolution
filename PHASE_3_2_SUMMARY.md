## Key Innovations

### 1. Integrated Conflict-Creativity Cycle
The system recognizes that conflict, when properly managed, can lead to creative breakthroughs. The conflict resolution system can trigger creative sessions to transform disagreements into innovation opportunities.

### 2. Multi-dimensional Relationship Modeling
Relationships are modeled across multiple dimensions simultaneously:
- Emotional bonds
- Trust dynamics
- Creative synergy
- Conflict patterns
- Communication quality

### 3. Predictive Social Intelligence
The system can predict:
- Likely conflict scenarios
- Creative collaboration success
- Emotional contagion spread
- Relationship trajectory changes

### 4. Adaptive Resolution Strategies
Conflict resolution adapts based on:
- Relationship history
- Cultural context
- Emotional states
- Previous resolution success

## Usage Examples

### Conflict Resolution
```python
# Detect and resolve conflict
conflict = conflict_resolver.detect_conflict(agent1, agent2)
if conflict:
    resolution = conflict_resolver.resolve_conflict(
        conflict.conflict_id,
        strategy='collaborative'
    )
```

### Creative Collaboration
```python
# Start creative session
session = creativity_engine.initiate_creative_session(
    participants=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    mode=CreativeMode.BRAINSTORMING,
    focus_area="innovative solutions"
)

# Contribute and build on ideas
idea = creativity_engine.contribute_idea(
    session.session_id,
    agent1,
    "Novel approach to problem"
)
```

### Relationship Monitoring
```python
# Monitor emotional states
emotional_state = emotion_monitor.update_emotional_state(
    agent_id,
    emotion_data
)

# Visualize relationships
visualizer.visualize_relationship_network(
    relationships,
    agents
)
```
