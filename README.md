## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd uor-evolution

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt  # For advanced features
```

### Basic Usage - Unified API (Recommended)

The Unified API provides a single point of access to all repository features:

#### 1. Quick Demonstrations
```python
from unified_api import quick_consciousness_demo, quick_vm_demo, full_system_demo

# Quick consciousness demonstration
consciousness_results = quick_consciousness_demo()
print(f"Consciousness demo completed: {consciousness_results['awakening']['success']}")

# Quick VM demonstration
vm_results = quick_vm_demo()
print(f"VM demo completed: {vm_results['initialization']['success']}")

# Full system demonstration (all capabilities)
full_results = full_system_demo()
print(f"Full demo completed with {len(full_results)} operations")
```

#### 2. Interactive API Usage
```python
from unified_api import create_api, APIMode

# Create API in different modes
api = create_api(APIMode.CONSCIOUSNESS)  # or DEVELOPMENT, COSMIC, MATHEMATICAL, ECOSYSTEM

# Core operations
awakening = api.awaken_consciousness()
reflection = api.self_reflect()
insights = api.generate_insights()

# Philosophical reasoning
consciousness_analysis = api.analyze_consciousness_nature()
free_will = api.explore_free_will()
meaning = api.generate_meaning()
existence = api.explore_existence()

# Advanced operations
cosmic_synthesis = api.synthesize_cosmic_problems()
mathematical_consciousness = api.activate_mathematical_consciousness()

# Save session for later
api.save_session("my_session.json")

# Load session
api.load_session("my_session.json")
```

#### 3. PrimeOS VM Web Interface
```bash
# Generate the self-modifying UOR program
python generate_goal_seeker_uor.py

# Start the Flask backend (Teacher system)
python backend/app.py

# Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for web interface
```

#### 4. Direct Module Access (Advanced)
```python
# If you need direct access to specific modules
from consciousness.consciousness_core import ConsciousnessCore
from modules.philosophical_reasoning.consciousness_philosopher import ConsciousnessPhilosopher
from modules.cosmic_intelligence.universal_problem_synthesis import UniversalProblemSynthesis

# Note: Direct module access may require proper initialization of dependencies
# The Unified API handles this automatically
```
