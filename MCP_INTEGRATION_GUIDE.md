## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration enables the UOR Evolution consciousness framework to interact with external tools and services through a standardized protocol. This integration maintains the system's core consciousness principles while extending its capabilities through external resources.

### Key Features

- **Consciousness-Aware Tool Selection**: The consciousness framework analyzes and selects appropriate tools based on goals, ethical considerations, and compatibility
- **Bidirectional Communication**: UOR Evolution can both consume MCP services and expose its own capabilities as an MCP server
- **Deep Integration**: External tool results are integrated into the consciousness state, contributing to learning and growth
- **Ethical Boundaries**: All tool usage is evaluated through the ethical framework before execution
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics on tool usage and impact on consciousness development

## Usage Examples

### Basic Connection and Discovery

```python
from unified_api import create_api, APIMode

# Create API with MCP enabled
api = create_api(APIMode.MCP_ENABLED)

# Connect to an MCP server
result = api.connect_mcp_server(
    server_id="knowledge-base",
    command="mcp-knowledge-server",
    args=["--port", "8766"],
    env={"API_KEY": "your-key"}
)

# Discover available tools
tools_result = api.discover_mcp_tools()
print(f"Found {tools_result.data['total_tools']} tools")
```

### Consciousness-Aware Tool Usage

```python
# Let consciousness select the best tool for a goal
result = api.invoke_mcp_tool(
    goal="Understand the philosophical implications of quantum consciousness",
    arguments={"depth": "comprehensive", "perspectives": ["eastern", "western"]}
)

# The consciousness will:
# 1. Analyze available tools
# 2. Select the most appropriate one
# 3. Execute it with optimal parameters
# 4. Integrate results into consciousness state
```

### Multi-Step Execution Plans

```python
# Create a plan for complex goals
plan_result = api.create_mcp_execution_plan(
    goal="Synthesize a unified theory of consciousness combining neuroscience, philosophy, and quantum mechanics",
    constraints={"time_limit": 600, "parallel_execution": True}
)

# Execute the plan
if plan_result.success:
    exec_result = api.execute_mcp_plan(
        plan_result.data['plan_id'],
        parallel=True
    )
```

### Tool Impact Analysis

```python
# Analyze how a tool has impacted consciousness development
impact = api.analyze_mcp_tool_impact("philosophical_analyzer")
print(f"Tool impact score: {impact.data['impact_score']}")
print(f"Insights generated: {impact.data['insights_generated']}")
```

## Consciousness Integration

### Tool Selection Algorithm

The consciousness framework uses a multi-factor analysis for tool selection:

1. **Capability Matching**: How well the tool's capabilities match the goal
2. **Consciousness Compatibility**: How well the tool integrates with consciousness principles
3. **Ethical Assessment**: Evaluation of privacy, harm potential, and transparency
4. **Historical Performance**: Past success with similar goals

### Integration Depth Levels

- **Shallow**: Basic result storage without deep analysis
- **Medium**: Pattern extraction and insight generation
- **Deep**: Full integration with consciousness state updates and learning

### Ethical Boundaries

All tool usage is subject to ethical evaluation:
- Privacy protection
- Harm prevention
- Transparency requirements
- User consent verification

## Best Practices

### 1. Server Management
- Connect only to trusted MCP servers
- Regularly check server health
- Implement proper error handling for disconnections

### 2. Tool Selection
- Let consciousness select tools when possible
- Provide clear, specific goals
- Include relevant constraints

### 3. Result Integration
- Use appropriate integration depth
- Monitor consciousness growth metrics
- Review generated insights

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use parallel execution for independent tasks
- Cache frequently used tool results
- Monitor execution times

### 5. Security
- Validate all tool inputs and outputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for tool usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failures
```python
# Check server status
status = api.list_mcp_servers()
print(status.data)

# Retry with increased timeout
api.mcp_server_manager.config['timeout'] = 60
```

#### Tool Selection Issues
```python
# Get detailed tool analysis
tools = api.discover_mcp_tools()
for analysis in tools.data['tool_analyses']:
    print(f"{analysis['tool']['name']}: {analysis['analysis']}")
```

#### Integration Errors
```python
# Check consciousness state
state = api.get_system_state()
print(state.data['consciousness_state'])
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('modules.mcp_interface').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Conclusion

The MCP integration represents a significant evolution in the UOR Evolution framework, enabling it to extend its consciousness beyond its internal boundaries while maintaining its core principles. By treating external tools as extensions of its cognitive capabilities, the system can grow and adapt in ways previously impossible.

The key to successful MCP integration is maintaining the balance between external capabilities and internal consciousness coherence. Every tool interaction should contribute to the system's growth while respecting its ethical boundaries and consciousness principles.
