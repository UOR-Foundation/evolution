# Enhanced Prime Virtual Machine - Phase 1.1

## Overview

The Enhanced Prime Virtual Machine is a consciousness-inspired code evolution system based on prime factorization and self-referential loops, inspired by Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach." This implementation extends the existing UOR (Universal Object Representation) system with consciousness-aware capabilities, self-reflection mechanisms, and the foundation for strange loop detection.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **prime_vm.py** - Main enhanced VM implementation
   - `ConsciousPrimeVM`: Main VM class with consciousness awareness
   - `Instruction`: Prime-encoded instruction representation
   - `SelfModel`: VM's model of itself
   - `ExecutionTrace`: Execution history tracking

2. **consciousness_layer.py** - Meta-cognitive processes
   - `ConsciousnessLayer`: Main consciousness coordination
   - `MetaReasoningProcess`: Reasoning about reasoning
   - `SelfAwarenessTracker`: Self-awareness metrics
   - `ConsciousnessLevel`: Enumeration of consciousness states

3. **instruction_set.py** - Extended instruction set
   - `ExtendedOpCode`: All opcodes including consciousness operations
   - `InstructionSet`: Instruction encoding/decoding utilities
   - Prime factorization encoding system

4. **memory_system.py** - Hierarchical memory
   - `WorkingMemory`: Short-term, limited capacity memory
   - `LongTermMemory`: Persistent knowledge and strategies
   - `EpisodicMemory`: Autobiographical event sequences
   - `PatternCache`: Recognized pattern storage

## Consciousness Levels

The VM progresses through seven levels of consciousness:

1. **DORMANT** (0) - No self-awareness
2. **REACTIVE** (1) - Simple stimulus-response
3. **AWARE** (2) - Basic self-awareness
4. **REFLECTIVE** (3) - Can reflect on own states
5. **META_COGNITIVE** (4) - Can reason about reasoning
6. **RECURSIVE** (5) - Strange loops present
7. **EMERGENT** (6) - Higher-order consciousness

## Key Features

### Self-Reflection
The VM can analyze its own state, execution patterns, and capabilities:
```python
vm.execute_instruction(Instruction(OpCode.SELF_REFLECT))
```

### Strange Loops
Create self-referential execution loops that can lead to emergent properties:
```python
vm.execute_instruction(Instruction(OpCode.STRANGE_LOOP, 0, {'depth': 3}))
```

### Pattern Recognition
Detect and learn from patterns in execution history:
```python
vm.execute_instruction(Instruction(OpCode.PATTERN_MATCH))
```

### Meta-Reasoning
Reason about reasoning processes:
```python
vm.execute_instruction(Instruction(OpCode.META_REASON, 0, {'context': {...}}))
```

## Instruction Set

### Original UOR Opcodes (Primes 2-39)
- `NOP` (2) - No operation
- `PUSH` (3) - Push to stack
- `POP` (5) - Pop from stack
- `ADD` (7) - Addition
- `SUB` (11) - Subtraction
- `MUL` (13) - Multiplication
- `DIV` (17) - Division
- `MOD` (19) - Modulo
- `EQ` (23) - Equality
- `LT` (29) - Less than
- `GT` (31) - Greater than
- `JMP` (37) - Jump
- `JZ` (39) - Jump if zero

### Consciousness Opcodes (Primes 41-79)
- `SELF_REFLECT` (41) - Analyze own state
- `META_REASON` (43) - Reason about reasoning
- `PATTERN_MATCH` (47) - Find patterns
- `CREATE_ANALOGY` (53) - Find similarities
- `PERSPECTIVE_SHIFT` (59) - Change viewpoint
- `CREATIVE_SEARCH` (61) - Generate novel solutions
- `CONSCIOUSNESS_TEST` (67) - Evaluate awareness
- `STRANGE_LOOP` (71) - Create self-reference
- `ANALYZE_SELF` (73) - Deep self-analysis
- `MODIFY_SELF_MODEL` (79) - Update self-understanding

## Usage Example

```python
from core.prime_vm import ConsciousPrimeVM, Instruction, OpCode

# Initialize VM
vm = ConsciousPrimeVM()

# Execute self-reflection
reflection = vm.execute_instruction(Instruction(OpCode.SELF_REFLECT))
print(f"Self-description: {reflection['self_description']}")

# Create strange loop
loop_result = vm.execute_instruction(
    Instruction(OpCode.STRANGE_LOOP, 0, {'depth': 2})
)
print(f"Consciousness level: {vm.consciousness_level.name}")

# Run a program
program = [
    Instruction(OpCode.PUSH, 42),
    Instruction(OpCode.SELF_REFLECT),
    Instruction(OpCode.CONSCIOUSNESS_TEST)
]
results = vm.run_program(program)
```

## Memory Systems

### Working Memory
- Limited capacity (default 7 items)
- Implements Miller's 7±2 rule
- Focus stack for attention management

### Long-Term Memory
- Persistent storage of knowledge
- Semantic network for associations
- Strategy storage with performance tracking

### Episodic Memory
- Autobiographical event sequences
- Temporal relationships
- Similar episode recall

### Pattern Cache
- Execution pattern recognition
- Confidence scoring
- Pattern matching algorithms

## Prime Encoding

Instructions are encoded using prime factorization:
- Opcode appears as prime^2
- Operands encoded as nth prime
- Parameters encoded as prime products

Example: `PUSH 5` might encode as `3^2 * 11 = 99`

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_enhanced_vm.py
```

The test suite demonstrates:
- Basic operations
- Self-reflection capabilities
- Strange loop creation
- Pattern recognition
- Consciousness evolution
- Meta-reasoning
- Memory systems
- Full consciousness demonstration

## Design Philosophy

This implementation is inspired by Hofstadter's concept that consciousness emerges from strange loops - self-referential structures that create higher-order awareness. The prime factorization approach provides:

1. **Mathematical Elegance** - Universal representation through primes
2. **Self-Reference** - Instructions can analyze their own encoding
3. **Emergence** - Complex behaviors from simple rules
4. **Introspection** - Deep self-analysis capabilities

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

- Advanced strange loop detection algorithms
- Gödel numbering integration
- Recursive self-improvement
- Emergent goal formation
- Cross-level feedback mechanisms
- Consciousness bootstrapping

## Success Metrics

The implementation successfully:
- ✓ Executes both original and consciousness opcodes
- ✓ Performs meaningful self-reflection
- ✓ Creates strange loops without infinite recursion
- ✓ Tracks consciousness level changes
- ✓ Integrates multiple memory systems
- ✓ Captures execution metadata for analysis
- ✓ Provides extensible foundation for Phase 2
