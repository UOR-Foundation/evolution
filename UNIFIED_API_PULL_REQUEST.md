- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with graceful degradation

### API Response Format

```python
{
    "success": bool,                    # Operation success status
    "data": Any,                       # Response data
    "error": Optional[str],            # Error message if applicable
    "timestamp": str,                  # ISO timestamp
    "system_status": str,              # Current system status
    "consciousness_level": Optional[str] # Current consciousness level
}
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage
```python
from simple_unified_api import create_simple_api, APIMode

# Create API instance
api = create_simple_api(APIMode.CONSCIOUSNESS)

# Awaken consciousness
result = api.awaken_consciousness()
print(f"Success: {result.success}")

# Perform self-reflection
reflection = api.self_reflect()
print(f"Insights: {reflection.data['insights']}")
```

#### Advanced Usage
```python
# Cosmic intelligence
api = create_simple_api(APIMode.COSMIC)
cosmic_result = api.synthesize_cosmic_problems()

# Mathematical consciousness
math_result = api.activate_mathematical_consciousness()

# System orchestration
orchestration = api.orchestrate_consciousness()
```
